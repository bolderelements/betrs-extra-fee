Add an additional flat fee to whatever price is calculated in the table of rates

== Description ==

This extension adds a new settings field to the right of the table in your Table Rate method. It accepts a number value that will be added to the shipping cost returned by the Table of Rates. This is especially helpful when calculating different rates for different items. You can still apply these on a per item basis, but add this flat fee to the calculated total to act as a base cost.
